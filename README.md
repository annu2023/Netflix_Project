# Netflix_Project
This project explores and analyzes Netflix content using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The goal is to derive insights about content types, genre trends, release patterns, and other aspects of Netflix's content catalog.

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization on a Netflix dataset to uncover insights into the types of content Netflix offers, release trends, genre distributions, and more. The analysis is done using Python's powerful data manipulation and visualization libraries.
